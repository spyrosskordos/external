	<p class="text">Vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by
		national or subnational governments in many countries, in which a
		vehicle is inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations
		governing safety, emissions, or both. Inspection can be required at
		various times, e.g., periodically or on the transfer of title to a
		vehicle. If required periodically, it is often termed periodic motor
		vehicle inspection; typical intervals are every two years and every
		year. When a vehicle passes inspection, often a sticker (inspection
		decal or inspection sticker) is placed on the vehicle's windshield or
		registration plate to simplify later controls. Inspection stations are
		places to drive inside to see if a vehicle passes inspection once a
		vehicle is due for inspection. In some jurisdictions, proof of
		inspection is required before a vehicle license or license plate can
		be issued or renewed. In others, once a vehicle passes inspection, an
		inspection decal is attached to the windshield or registration plate,
		and police can enforce the inspection law by seeing whether the
		vehicle displays an up-to-date decal. There is some controversy over
		whether periodically inspecting motor vehicles is a cost-effective way
		to improve road traffic safety. In our country, every passenger
		vehicle is required to undergo an inspection after four years from
		purchase (if new) and then every two years. Taxis, learner vehicles
		and heavy transport vehicles must undergo an inspection every year.
		Inspection centers can be either public or private companies. Private
		vehicle technical control centres had to be accredited according to
		ISO 17020 standard. This requirement changed and P-VTCCs must be
		certified according to ISO 9001:2008 standard.</p>

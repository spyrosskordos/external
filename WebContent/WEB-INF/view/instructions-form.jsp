	<h1>VEHICLE MAINTENANCE TIPS</h1>
	<p class="text">
		Throughout the rest of this website you'll find in-depth articles
		describing in intricate detail how everything automotive works. On
		this page, I've simplified all that knowledge into a series of basic
		car maintenance tips, subdivided by category. These tips apply to
		pretty much every car owner, from business fleet owners, to
		specialists like a limo service, to the weekend hobbyist. Basic car
		maintenance really isn't that hard. There are simple things that you
		can do on your own like being able to

		use a silicone lubricant to protect your car from rusting. Some tips
		have simple explanations right here whilst others link back to the
		articles in the rest of the site. If you can't find what you're
		looking for, try the search button at the end of the top menu. If you
		still can't find what you're looking for, or have a suggestion for
		something else I should cover, contact me using the contact button on
		the top menu bar.

	<h3>TSBs and wiring diagrams</h3>
	<p class="text">If you're looking for TSB (Technical Service
		Bulletins) or wiring diagrams for your vehicle, BBB industries have
		access to most of them for free. (Almost any decent car shop will have
		access to this sort of information - as the owner, you should too).
		BBB's search page is well worth a look. Major recalls normally result
		in owners being contacted, but minor ones get done each time a vehicle
		is taken to a main network dealer. TSBs are the bulletins sent to the
		dealer networks containing info on known bugs and issues with all
		makes and models that need to be rectified when the vehicles come in.

	
	<h1>Wheels and tyres</h1>
	<h3>Rotate your tyres!</h3>
	<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/css/images/checkyourpressures.jpg" alt="check your tyre pressure"
		width="129" height="250" class="leftimagenoborder">
	<p class="text">
		Every 5,000 miles or 8,000km, rotate your tyres. 
	</p>
	<h3>Clean brake dust off regularly</h3>
	<p class="text">Brake dust contains all sorts of nasty stuff. If
		you leave it too long, the combination of road grime, moisture and
		heat from your brakes will bake it on to your wheels. Brake dust
		normally clings to wheels with static electricity so a damp sponge and
		clean cold water is the best way to get it off.</p>

	<h3>Check your tyre pressures</h3>
	<p class="text">
		Check your tyre pressures regularly - once a week is ideal. Bad tyre
		pressures can affect fuel economy, handling and comfort. It's easy to
		do and there is no excuse not to.
	</p>

	<h3>Check your tread depth</h3>
	<p class="text">
		Bald, slick tyres might be good for motor racing but they're no good
		on the road. Most tyres come with tread wear bars built into them now
		- find one, examine it and if your tread is too low, replace your
		tyres. Four new tyres might seem expensive but they're cheaper than a
		fine or an accident.
	</p>

	<!-- carID -->
	<br>
	<p class="text">
		While lurking on the Internet and collect the best tips for you, I
		tried to find the best online-resource with different wheels and
		tires. I found CARiD website as a really good place to do shopping: 
		They offer ultimate wheels and tires collection, largest selection and
		truly dedicated team of experts to help you!
	</p>

	<h1>Engine</h1>
	<h3>Check your belts</h3>
	<p class="text">
		At the front of your engine there will be a series of rubber drive
		belts that loop around various pulleys, driving everything from the
		alternator to the a/c compressor. Rubber perishes, more so in extreme
		conditions like those found in an operating engine bay. Get your
		timing belt and accessory drive belt checked every 25,000 miles,
		preferably replacing it every 50,000 miles.
	</p>

	<h3>Fuel Economy</h3>
	<p class="text">
		Check your tyre pressures regularly - once a week is ideal. Bad tyre
		pressures can affect fuel economy very noticeably. It's easy to do and
		there is no excuse not to.
	</p>

	<h3>Checking your oil level</h3>
	<p class="text">
		This is something everyone can do - it's quick and easy and it'll tell
		you if your engine needs oil. If the oil is too high or too low, it
		can cause trouble for your engine. To check the oil, park on level
		ground and wait until the engine has cooled down after driving, then
		locate the dipstick. Pull it out and wipe it clean, then push it all
		the way back in until the top of it is seated properly in the dip tube
		again. Wait a moment then pull it out again. Check the level of the
		oil. If it's between the high and low marks, you're fine. (If it's too
		low, add a little.) The high and low marks can be denoted by two dots,
		an "H" and "L" or a shaded area on the dipstick. The photos below show
		a Honda dipstick which has the two dots. <strong>Why not just
			read the level first time around?</strong> The first time you pull the
		dipstick out, it will have oil all over it and it will be difficult to
		tell where the level is. That's why you need to wipe it on a rag to
		get a clean dipstick, then dip it back into the oil to get a good
		reading.

	<h3>Checking your coolant level</h3>
	<p class="text">
		Again, something everyone can do. The coolant is the other thing your
		engine cannot go without. Every engine is different but if you check
		your handbook you should find where the coolant reservoir is. It will
		normally be bolted to one side of the engine bay or the other, and be
		a white semi-transparent bottle. Wait until your engine is cool and
		take a look at it - the outside should have 'low' and 'high' markings
		on it and the level of coolant inside should be between the two.<br>
		<strong>Do <u>not</u> take the radiator cap off to check
			coolant levels. If the coolant system is still hot then it is still
			under pressure and the pressure release will burn you.
		</strong> 
	</p>


	<h1>Fuel / gas</h1>
	<h3>Will higher octane or premium fuel give me better gas mileage
		and/or more power?</h3>
	<p class="text">
		<strong>No.</strong> Sportier cars have higher compression engines
		which generate more power and require higher octane fuel to prevent
		detonation. That's where the myth of "premium = more power" came from.
		If your handbook says "regular", use regular.
	</p>

	<h1>Bodywork / paint</h1>
	<h3>Keeping your paint finish in good condition</h3>
	<p class="text">
		Only choose superior car detailing supplies to keep your car's
		interior and exterior like new. There are plenty of decent quality
		waxes and polishes on the market today and if the last time you waxed
		or polished your car was over a decade ago, things have changed
		considerably since then. The wax and polish compounds are far more
		sophisticated both in terms of protection from fading, the look of the
		finish, and the ease of application. For example Turtle Wax Ice gets
		rid of that old problem of white wax residue. Is a clean car a vanity
		thing? Partly, yes, but if you park under a tree where birds help
		repaint your car with recycled blueberries, that guck will come off a
		lot easier if it falls on a waxed paint job.<br> <strong>Tip:</strong>
		If you find a bird has pooped on your car, wash it off as quick as you
		can. There are compounds in bird waste that can damage most car paint
		jobs. If you leave it in the sun and the poop bakes on, you could end
		up with a dull spot in the paint.<br>
		
	</p>

	<h1>Electrical</h1>
	<h3>Disconnecting and reconnecting your battery</h3>
	<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/css/images/negativefirst.jpg" alt="negative battery terminal"
		width="400" height="311" class="rightimagenoborder">
	<p class="text">
		If you're going to do any work on your car involving the electrical
		system, disconnect the battery first. To do this, loosen the connector
		for the negative/ground terminal first, and wiggle the terminal cap
		off. Use a wire-tie or similar to tie the cable back out of the way.
		If you need to take the battery out, you can now take off the positive
		connector.<br> <strong>Why negative then positive?</strong> If
		you disconnect the positive side of the battery first, the negative
		side is still connected to the entire car. If you drop a tool and it
		lands on the positive battery terminal and touches anything else on
		the car, you'll have an electrical short. By disconnecting the
		negative first, you're cutting off the return path for the current.
		Now, if a tool drops on to either of the battery terminals, it doesn't
		matter if it touches part of the chassis or not - there's no
		continuous path for the electrical current.<br> <strong>Reconnecting
			your battery.</strong> Connect the positive terminal first, and the negative
		second - the reverse of removal, and for the same reasons. When you
		slip the negative connector on, there will be a spark as it gets close
		and makes contact with the negative battery terminal. Don't be afraid
		of this - it's nothing to worry about. Make sure the terminal caps are
		done up nice and tight.
	</p>
	<h3>Check your battery terminals</h3>
	<p class="text">Most modern cars run on a 12 volt negative ground
		electrical system. If your battery terminals or contacts aren't clean,
		you're making it more difficult for the current to pass around the
		electrical system. Remove the terminal caps as described above and
		clean each contact post with a wire brush to get a nice clean metal
		contact surface. Do the same to the terminal caps, then reattach them
		as described above.</p>

	<h1>Lights</h1>
	<h3>One indicator or blinker is flashing faster than the other</h3>
	<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/css/images/lights.jpg" alt="negative battery terminal"
		width="400" height="311" class="rightimagenoborder">
	<p class="text">When you indicate one way and the blinker flashes
		quicker than when you indicate the other way, it means one of the
		bulbs has blown. An auto parts store will be able to tell you what
		sort of bulb you need to replace it with and your manual should show
		you how to get at the indicator bulbs - they're different on every
		car.</p>

	<h3>Don't touch the glass when changing headlight bulbs</h3>
	<p class="text">Most headlight bulbs now are filled with halogen
		and have special coatings on the outside of the glass. If you pick the
		bulb up by the glass with your fingers, you will leave trace amounts
		of oil and grease on the glass. When the bulb is used, that area of
		the glass will get hotter than the rest and it will eventually cause
		the bulb to crack. When changing headlight bulbs, only hold the metal
		bulb holder at the base, or make sure you're wearing rubber surgical /
		mechanic's gloves (clean ones) if you're touching the glass.</p>
